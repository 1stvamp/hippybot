ChangeLog for hippybot
======================
1.2.6.2 (2015-06-10)
------------------

 - Some plugins want to already have bot's parsed config during the initialization. So, if the __init__() of the plugin class accepts the 'config' parameter - bot.py will try to pass it inside.
   Look into hippybot/plugins/threaded_example.py for an example.
